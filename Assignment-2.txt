Q1. What is Single Page Application(SPA) ?

Ans1. SPA stands for Single Page Application.It is a type of web application that loads a
 single HTML page and updates its content dynamically, with interactive user experience.
 React is used to build SPAs due to its component-based architecture and efficient
rendering through the use of the Virtual DOM. 

Key characteristics of SPAs are :-

1. Single HTML Page:  SPAs load a single HTML page, subsequent updates to the content are
 handled dynamically without requiring full page reloads. 

2. Dynamic Updates: React allows developers to create interactive user interfaces where
 changes to the application state and updates to specific components. These updates 
 are efficiently managed through the Virtual DOM, resulting in faster and more responsive
user experiences. 

3. Component-Based Architecture: React's component-based architecture ensures modularity
 and reusability. Different parts of the application are within components,making it easier
to manage and maintain code.

Q2. What is DNS and IP Address?

Ans2. DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a hierarchical and distributed system that translates
human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. When you enter a 
domain name into your web browser, the browser needs to find the corresponding IP address
to establish a connection with the server hosting the website.

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address): An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each
 device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.0.1) and IPv6 
(e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv4 is more commonly used, but IPv6 is 
becoming increasingly important as IPv4 addresses run out.

Q3. What is React and why we use React instead of JS?

Ans3. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for building
 single-page applications where the content updates dynamically without requiring a full 
 page reload. Here are some key aspects of React and reasons why it's commonly used in web
development:

1. Declarative Syntax
2. Component-Based Architecture
3. Virtual DOM
4. One-Way Data Binding
5. JSX (JavaScript XML)

Q4. What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js ?

Ans 4. JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is commonly associated
with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. JSX allows you to write
HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe the structure of UI 
components.This helps in combining UI markup and logic in a single file, making the code
 more readable and maintainable.While JSX is a common and convenient way to write React 
 components, it's not mandatory. React can also be written using pure JavaScript without
  JSX. However, JSX is widely adopted in the React community due to its readability and
   ease of use.JSX syntax will feel natural. It looks similar to XML/HTML, but it gets 
transformed into JavaScript.

Q5. What is package.json ?

Ans 5. package.json is a configuration file used in Node.js and many JavaScript projects,
including React applications. It is typically located at the root of a project's directory
and contains metadata about the project.  It plays a crucial role in managing and
building modern JavaScript projects.One of the most important aspects of package.json 
for a React project is the definition of dependencies. These dependencies are the
external libraries and packages that your project are on. Dependencies are the packages
 required for the application to run in a production environment.

 Q6. What is the difference between react and react native ? Which one is library or 
    framework ?

Ans 6. React and React Native are both developed by Facebook and are used for building user
 interfaces, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.React is
  a JavaScript library.  React is used for building user interfaces for web
   applications. It is designed to create interactive and dynamic UIs that efficiently
update in response to data changes. 
React Native is a framework. React Native is used for building mobile applications for iOS
 and Android. It allows developers to use React components to build a mobile UI that is
  native to the platform.React Native uses components to build UI elements. However, these
   components are different from web-based React components, as they are specifically
    designed for mobile platforms.

Q7. What is the difference between Class and Functional Component ?

Ans 7. Class Component : In React, a Class Component is a JavaScript class that extends the
 React.Component base class. Class components are the traditional way of creating component
 s in React, and they have been used since the early versions of the library. Class
  components are ES6 classes that encapsulate a component's logic and behavior. 

 Functional Component : Functional components in React are a simpler and more concise way
to define components compared to class components. They are JavaScript functions that
take props as an argument and return React elements, describing what should be rendered
on the screen. Functional components were initially stateless and didn't have access to
lifecycle methods, but with the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional
components can now manage state and use lifecycle methods, making them powerful and
flexible.

Q8. What is DOM in JS?

Ans8. The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It
 represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds
to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, text, etc. The DOM provides a 
way for programs (such as JavaScript) to manipulate the structure, style, and content of
web documents dynamically.
